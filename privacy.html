        Effective date: <strong>2026-02-26</strong> • Contact: <strong>eva.madarasz3@gmail.com</strong>
      </div>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how BuyWise (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use the BuyWise mobile app
        (“App”). We aim to collect as little personal data as possible.
      </p>

      <div class="hr"></div>

      <h2>1) Information you provide</h2>
      <p>
        BuyWise may allow you to enter values such as income, hourly wage, weekly hours, and purchase prices. This information
        is used to calculate results in-app.
      </p>

      <h2>2) How data is stored</h2>
      <p>
        By default, the data you enter is stored locally on your device (e.g., via iOS storage mechanisms). We do not receive
        your entries unless you explicitly share them.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Purchases (Apple / RevenueCat)</h2>
      <p>
        If you make a purchase, Apple processes the payment. We do not receive your full payment information. We may use
        RevenueCat to manage entitlements (purchase status) and to support restoring purchases.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>RevenueCat may process identifiers required to validate purchases and entitlements.</li>
        <li>We use this information to unlock premium access and to restore purchases.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        BuyWise may use privacy-friendly analytics (or none). If analytics are used, they help us understand app performance
        (crashes, feature usage, general diagnostics). If you add analytics later, update this section to name the provider
        and what data is collected.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Data sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with service providers only as needed to operate the App
        (e.g., purchase/entitlement providers), and only for the purposes described in this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        Your in-app entries remain on your device unless you delete the app or clear the app’s data. Purchase/entitlement
        records are retained as necessary to provide access and comply with legal obligations (typically via Apple/RevenueCat).
      </p>

      <h2>7) Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can delete the app to remove locally stored data.</li>
        <li>You can manage Apple ID purchase settings in iOS.</li>
        <li>You can use “Restore Purchases” to re-enable access on a new device (same Apple ID).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8) Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        BuyWise is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your region). We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children.
      </p>

      <h2>9) International users</h2>
      <p>
        Your data may be processed in countries where our service providers operate. We take reasonable measures to protect
        your information.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
      </p>
